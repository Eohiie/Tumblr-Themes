#Tumblr-Themes

##Introduction

This is the place where I put all my modified themes, and all required files.

##Usage

All of these are availiable for use, I just request that you keep the credit where it's due. All you need to copy is the main .tumblr file. The rest is taken care of.

##Credits
These themes were made possible with:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

##License

All themes use their original license, which is usually the Creative Commons 3.0.
